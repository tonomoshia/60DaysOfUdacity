### Day 1 - 03.08.22

1. Worked on and turned in Project 1.

2. Since my progress from the Challenge course didn’t transfer over, I will start reviewing it to see what’s new.

3. Nothing at this time. Good to go.

### Day 2 - 03.11.22

1. I read the review I received of my first project, worked on it and resubmitted. Starting going through the First section which we already did in the challenge course as my progress did not transfer over. Perused Project 2, read the rubric and downloaded the project files.

2. Tomorrow I will look into the project files and go through the quiz to familiarize myself with the data set. Also read up about making the dashboard as I really did not understand that that well in the Challenge course. The videos were not helpful.

3. Blocker - not understanding the dashboard procedure and how to create ‘scenarios’.

### Day 3 - 03.14.22
1. Watch 30 minutes of [SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY) from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
2. Figure out Index & Match (!!)
3. Time, procrastination and motivation. I see so many people having trouble with Project 2 and I feel like I am going to have an even more difficult time. Kinda avoiding it.

### Day 4 - 03.16.22
1. Started Using SQL for Data Analysis - 
   1. Completed Lesson 1: Intro to Using SQL for Data Analytics.
   2.  Started Lesson 2: Basic SQL (up to section 7).
2. Continue Lesson 2: Basic SQL.
3. None. Will do Project 2 later.
