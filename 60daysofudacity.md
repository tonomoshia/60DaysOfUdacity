# 60 Days of Udacity

1. What did I learn today?

2. What will I learn tomorrow?

3. What issues are blocking my progress?



## Day 1

1. Worked on and turned in Project 1. 

2. Since my progress from the Challenge course didn’t transfer over, I will start reviewing it to see what’s new.

3. Nothing at this time. Good to go.



## Day 2 

1. I read the review I received of my first project, worked on it and resubmitted. Starting going through the First section which we already did in the challenge course as my progress did not transfer over. Perused Project 2, read the rubric and downloaded the project files.

2. Tomorrow I will look into the project files and go through the quiz to familiarize myself with the data set. Also read up about making the dashboard as I really did not understand that that well in the Challenge course. The videos were not helpful.

3. Blocker - not understanding the dashboard procedure and how to create ‘scenarios’.
