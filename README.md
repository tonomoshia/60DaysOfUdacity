# 60DaysOfUdacity
Tracking work on Business Analytics Udacity Nanodegree

I appled for and was accepted into the Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship. 
After a Challenge Course (Phase 1), I took a final assessment and I was able to move into the Nanodegree (Phase 2) which includes SQL and Tableau.

## [What is 60 Days of Udacity Challenge?][1]
The general premise  is to build a habit by making a public commitment of working in your classroom every day for 60 days within Phase 2 of your Bertelsmann Technology Scholarship Challenge! 
 
Habits that emphasise consistent practice have been proven to help overall retention of new learning material. The motive through this challenge is to help you build time-line driven goals in terms of the Nanodegree, track your progress regularly, and commit to the goal as a team so that you can help each other achieve it!

(We track these in a Slack channel for our cohort but I am tracking mine here as well since the Slack channel is free and posts are not permanent.)
